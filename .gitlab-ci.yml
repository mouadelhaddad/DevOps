# Gitlab CI yml file
# GitLab CI uses the services keyword to define what docker containers should be linked with your base image. Since we are using docker as our image we'll be using docker:dind i.e. Docker-In-Docker-Image
services:
- docker:dind

# Since we are using Alpine, everything is not installed by default.
# Thus we are setting up the basics

# Environemt Variable for docker:dind service explaining to use overlay2 as supporting driver for docker
variables:
  DOCKER_DRIVER: overlay2
  DOCKER_HOST : tcp://localhost:2375
  DOCKER_TLS_CERTDIR: ""

# This is the major part of the code which explains the stages present in our pipeline.
# In a django application we have various stages which include testing, packing the code,
# performing migrations, collecting static files and running the application.
# The various stages are broadly classified into 3 main categories:

# 1. Test       2. Release      3. Deploy
before_script:
  # Installing requirements
  - apk update && apk upgrade && apk add --no-cache bash openssh

stages:
- test
- build
- deploy

# Stage I
# Testing Phase:
# This is where the main code is tested.
# Other options like code coverage, etc are also written in this phase
test:
  stage: test
  # This repo includes python3, pip3 and postgres so that I need not
  # setup python and postgres separately.
